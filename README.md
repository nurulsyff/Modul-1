# Python for Data Analysis

Data analysis is a way to explore essential findings and communicate patterns found in the data. Data Analysis aims to get insights or findings that can be followed up on the decision-making process to get better business results. In this mini-project of the Data Analysis part, I will show you how to deal with empty data and data aggregation with Pandas. 
The data I used in this mini project are :
1. Salaries data (https://www.kaggle.com/rsadiq/salary). This data consists of the salary and years of experience of 35 jobholders. 
2. audi.csv, hyundai.csv, toyota.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes?select=toyota.csv). The data set contains price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size.

An error can cause missing value in retrieving data or because the data is not available. In statistics, a missing value can interfere with the analysis and cause bias. Therefore, the ability to detect and handle missing values is essential as a Data Scientist. Data aggregation is the process of collecting and compiling data into a summary. The results of data aggregation are carried out to answer specific business objectives or for further analysis. Furthermore, I use Pandas to view basic statistics in specific columns.
